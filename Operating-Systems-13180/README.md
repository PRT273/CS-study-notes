Discrete Mathematics



This repository contains my study notes and learning logs for Discrete Mathematics,

based on the Chinese self-study exam textbook 《离散数学》

(course code: 02324).



The goal of this repository is not just to store formulas or answers,

but to record how I gradually understood abstract concepts

that I had never systematically learned before.



\## Why this repository exists:

Discrete Mathematics was my first serious exposure to formal logic, relations, graphs, and algebraic structures.



At the beginning, many concepts felt extremely abstract:

predicates and quantifiers

relations and closures

equivalence vs order relations

graphs, trees, and algorithms



This repository exists to:

document how confusion turned into understanding

keep track of mistakes, misunderstandings, and corrections

build a solid mathematical foundation for future CS studies



\## Contents

Chapter1\_Notes.md – Propositional logic: basic concepts \& truth tables

Chapter2\_Notes.md – Logical equivalence \& inference rules

Chapter3\_Notes.md – Predicate logic, quantifiers, formal reasoning

Chapter4\_Notes.md – Sets, set operations, Cartesian products

Chapter5\_Notes.md – Relations, properties, closures, functions

Chapter6\_Notes.md – Algebraic systems, semigroups, groups

Chapter7\_Notes.md – Lattices and Boolean algebra

Chapter8\_Notes.md – Graph theory fundamentals

Chapter9\_Notes.md – Graph applications (Euler, Hamilton, MST, shortest paths)





\## Learning Notes Style



Notes are written mainly in Chinese, with emphasis on:

intuitive explanations before formal definitions

common mistakes and “why this is confusing at first”

exam-oriented key points (self-study exam focused)

simple language instead of over-formal math writing



Some explanations are informal and personal,

reflecting real learning struggles, not polished lecture notes.





Learning Logs



This repository also includes:

stage-based learning reflections

moments of confusion and how they were resolved

notes on which topics required repeated revision



These logs are intentionally kept,

because understanding abstract math is a process, not a one-time event.





Learning Progress



Started: Late 2025

Current status:

Completed one full pass of all chapters

Can follow most definitions, proofs, and standard exam problems



Current weaknesses:

Proof fluency (especially relation properties \& closures)

Speed and confidence in non-routine problems



Next steps:

Systematic problem-solving practice

Strengthen proof-based thinking

Connect discrete math concepts to algorithms and data structures





Long-term Goal:

Build a reliable mathematical foundation for Computer Science

Prepare for Bachelor → Master level CS studies

Gradually bridge the gap between exam-oriented math

and more rigorous university-level discrete mathematics



This repository is part of my long-term learning portfolio,

showing not only what I know,

but how I learned it.
